What's up today.

- Add some form styling from Bulma. This has gone badly. I wasted a huge amount of time attempting to install node-sass. I spent about 4 hours on it. So dumb. I don't need Sass. And I don't even need individual Bulma modules. All I ever needed was the full library. Yet I went down 15 different rabbit holes on this. I was looking up things about node-gyp and libsass and npm and apt-get and blah, blah, blah.
- Before that, I wasted another 4 or 5 hours on a deep dive into how to use React hooks with forms, particularly registration and log-in forms. Good stuff, but beside the point.
